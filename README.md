# CVE-2018-7600-drupalgeddon2-scanner
Drupalgeddon2 POC + Scanner (adapted)

ONLY FOR Drupal < 7.58 (Not tested on Drupal 8)

Requirements:
+ python3
+ requests (use pip install)

Usage:
```
+ c:   Scan a CIDR range
+ f:   Scan with a file as input (1 IP per line)
+ i:   Scan a single IP
+ m:   Scan multiple given IPs (separated by commas)
+ r:   Scan a given IP range (use nmap's IP range format)
+ v:   Print more verbose messages
```

Command:
```
python drupalgeddon2-scan.py <IP(s) to be scanned>
```  

Note:
Since this is meant as a scanner, the result/output of the run command will be ignored.
But if you are still interested, modify the following line to change the command run, changing the value of 'id' to the command you wish to run: 
``` python
send_params = {..., 'name[#markup]':'id', ...}
```
After that, print out the value of 'out' in the exploit function
